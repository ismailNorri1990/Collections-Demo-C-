# Collections-Demo-C-
Read Countries from file with C#

This is an List Manipilation , it change the code of the first version in the master.
instead of importing a specific number or countries from a list it import all the list.

Same to the version in the Master just tape this command in the console after navigation inside the folder : dotnet run Country_C#_Collections.csproj
